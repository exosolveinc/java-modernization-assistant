  "rollback_plan": "In the event of any issues during the migration, have a well-defined rollback plan in place. This may include reverting to the previous Java version, restoring from backups, and implementing a gradual rollout strategy to minimize disruption.",
  "risk_summary": "The migration from Java 8 to Java 17 poses a moderate risk due to the potential for compatibility issues and the need to address deprecated APIs. However, by following a phased approach, utilizing automated migration tools, and implementing a robust testing strategy, the overall risk can be effectively managed. The final optimization and refactoring phase will help ensure the codebase is optimized for Java 17 and takes advantage of the latest language features."
